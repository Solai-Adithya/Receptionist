## Description

Presently, we face scheduling and managing queues for applications like virtual Viva/Interviews conducted by Professors and Organizations. \
There may be many interviewees in the queue and one person making it late or taking too much time messing up the schedule of others.

This website will show a pop-up message when the person is in queue before you get finished with his interview.

## Usage

You just need to log in to our website with your email id with which you're registered for your interview.\
And then you need to just wait for our pop-up to show up when your turns come.

In parallel, you can also complete your assignments or may even finish up your last slice of pizza :P without worrying about missing your turn.

Enjoy
